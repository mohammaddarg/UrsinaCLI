# UrsinaCLI

Version: Pre-Alpha I guess... I don't really know...

## Installation
Since I have to figure some command line stuff out, for now, just use  ```us <command>``` inside of CMD(opened on the place where you have installed this CLI).

## Usage
To create a new project, run ```us new <project name>```.

To create a new entity, run ```us ent <entity name>```.
You can change entities/template.py to customize your entity classes.
Imports will automaticly be added to entities/entities.py; you may want to put your starting entites there(these entities can be built-in ones like FirstPersonCamera). Changing the list to be a dictionary may help for some projects.

To run the game, simply run the main.py file or use the ```us run``` command. for now, they don't do anything diffrent, but more functionality may be added to the command in the future.

## License
I don't have permition from Ursina to develope this CLI, but since they use MIT License, there should not be a problem. However, if Ursina devs ask, I will change the name of this project or even delete it.
